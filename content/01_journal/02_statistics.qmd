# Load the table
random_vars <- readRDS("C:\Users\Shweta\Documents\GitHub\cdsba-shwetaambade\random_vars.rds")

# Compute expected value, variance, and standard deviation for each variable
expected_value <- colMeans(random_vars)
variance <- apply(random_vars, 2, var)
std_dev <- sqrt(variance)

# Compare standard deviations
# Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of values. Comparing them makes sense if the variables are measured in the same units. A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability.

# Examine the relationship between variables
covariance_matrix <- cov(random_vars)
correlation_matrix <- cor(random_vars)

# Interpretation of covariance and correlation:
# Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It is not normalized, so its magnitude is not directly interpretable.
# Correlation is a normalized measure, ranging from -1 to 1. It provides a standardized way to interpret the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.

# Compute conditional expected values
conditional_expected_value_age_18 <- mean(random_vars$income[random_vars$age <= 18])
conditional_expected_value_age_18_65 <- mean(random_vars$income[random_vars$age >= 18 & random_vars$age < 65])
conditional_expected_value_age_65 <- mean(random_vars$income[random_vars$age >= 65])
